# kaze
Kaze is a productivity launcher which helps you organise they way you use your apps, based on your routine. It lets you add the essential apps you require during a daily task in your timetable and Kaze will make sure that you are away from all the distracting apps by "locking" the distracting apps and only allowing you to use the selected apps.

Another really creative feature that inhabits the designs of Kaze is the 'focus mode'. It asks you to choose the five most important apps you need while doing a task of utmost importance. Once selected, Kaze won't let you operate any other app on your phone except those five, unless you exit focus mode, which is 5 touches away :)

Achieved over 1.5K+ downloads on a beta release and garnered a 4.2 average rating of the app from all the reviews.Kaze is a productivity launcher which helps you organise they way you use your apps, based on your routine.

# Technical Details
Kaze was built using Flutter, a Dart framework which specialises in building cross-platform applications. Several dependencies were used to build the app, namely:
- firebase
- google 
- sqflite

SQLite was used as a relational database to store user data on the devices itself making it completely secure. Created data models to store complex user data to increase performance and modularity.

Implemented the entire codebase using a template-driven architecture, leveraging advanced abstractions and design patterns for structure and maintainability. Incorporated performance optimizations, including efficient memory management and algorithmic enhancements.
