# kaze
An android launcher which helps you organise the way you use your apps, based on your routine. Lets you add only the essential apps relevant to your timetable and “lock” away all the distracting apps

The 'focus mode' feature allows you top only use the five most important apps you need. Once selected, Kaze won't let you operate any other app on your phone except those five, unless you exit focus mode, which is 5 touches away :)

Achieved over 1.5K+ downloads on a beta release and garnered a 4.2 average rating of the app from all the reviews. Nearly 1.1k downloads were through organic search, which is ~65% of the total downloads and ~32% returning users. 

# Technical Details
Kaze was built using Flutter, a Dart framework which specialises in building cross-platform applications. Several dependencies were used to build the app, namely:
- firebase
- google 
- sqflite

SQLite was used as a relational database to store user data on the devices itself making it completely secure. Created data models to store complex user data to increase performance and modularity.

Implemented the entire codebase using a template-driven architecture, leveraging advanced abstractions and design patterns for structure and maintainability. Incorporated performance optimizations, including efficient memory management and algorithmic enhancements.

# Design Details
[Refers to the figma link which I used to design the application](https://www.figma.com/design/iJnqCULNNOYt53GYdQj40k/kaze?node-id=229-2&t=jw5fx0nPASjmN6Y0-1)

# Certifications 
Participated in a student's Indian Business Competition, [IFT (India's Future Tycoons)](https://www.indiafuturetycoons.com/) and placed overall 2nd among 25k+ students. The competition really helped shape an idea to fruitation and made me understand the critical user needs. It was incredible to be a part of this journey.
